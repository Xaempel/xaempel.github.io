                    I'll be writing about topics I've gone over before to refresh my knowledge. I might make small
                    mistakes like spelling errors or explain things badly sometimes â€” so just keep that in mind.

                    I wanna improve my English through practice, and I think writing a blog about my interests is the
                    best way to do it.

                    On this site, I can show what I've learned and what I'm currently learning, so it's a good way to
                    present myself. In addition, I can showcase my projects.
