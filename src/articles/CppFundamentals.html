        Fundamentals of C++
    </h1>

    <main>
        <h2>Beginning</h2>
        <p>
            To begin writing C++ code, all you need is a C++ compiler. Two popular choices are <b>g++ (part of GCC)</b>
            and <b>Clang</b>. I won't provide a tutorial on how to install a compiler here — it's easy to find one
            online, or you can use an online C++ compiler to get started quickly. If you already have a compiler, let's
            begin!
        </p>

        <h2>First Step into C++ - Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch'entrate</h2>
        <p>
            The first program that almost everyone writes when learning a programming language is the classic Hello
            World app. This program is very simple because it contains only one instruction: it displays text on the
            terminal screen.
            In C++, such a program looks like this:
        <pre><code>
            #include &lt;iostream&gt;

            int main() {
                std::cout &lt&lt "Hello, World\n";
                return 0;
            }
        </code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            At first glance, this code might seem intimidating, but it's actually very straight forward. Let's break it
            down line by line:
        <ul>
            <li>
                #include &ltiostream&gt - In short, #include allows us to use predefined types, functions, or algorithms
                from
                the standard library. In this case, we are adding basic input/output functionality to our program.
            </li>

            <li>
                int main() - This is the entry point of the program. The curly braces {} enclose the code that will
                be executed when the program runs.
            </li>

            <li>
                std::cout &lt&lt "Hello World" ; - This instruction displays text on the terminal. The std::cout &lt&lt
                part
                sends the text inside the quotes ("") to the output. </li>

            <li>
                \n - This symbol tells the program to insert a new line into the output.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Next Steps in C++ - Variables and Basic Arithmetic Operators</h2>
        <p>
            Now that you know how to print output to the terminal, the next step is to learn about variables and
            arithmetic operations.
            A variable is like a box where you can store data.
            In C++, there are many different types of variables, but to get started you only need three or four basic
            ones: int, float, char, and std::string.

        <ul>
            <li>
                int - stores integer values like 9, 12, 32, 10512.
            </li>

            <li>
                float - stores floating-point values like 1.23, 125.125, 512.3.
            </li>

            <li>
                char - stores a single character like 'a', 'b', 'y'.
            </li>

            <li>
                std::string - stores a sequence of characters (text). To use strings, you must include the &ltstring&gt
                header.
            </li>
        </ul>

        Here's an example:
        <pre>
            <code>
                #include &ltiostream&gt
                #include &ltstring&gt

                int main() {
                    int a {5};
                    float b {3.12};
                    char ch {'A'};
                    std::string sentence {"This is a sentence"};
                }
            </code>
        </pre>

        Explanation:
        <ul>
            <li>
                #include &ltiostream&gt - You already know this from the previous example.
            </li>

            <li>
                #include &ltstring&gt - Adds support for using std::string.
            </li>

            <li>
                int a, float b, char ch – Declare variables of types int, float, and char.
            </li>

            <li>
                std::string sentence - Declares a variable of type std::string. The std:: prefix means the type comes
                from the C++ standard library (just like std::cout).
                This example shows how to initialize variables in C++ using curly braces {}. This method is preferred in
                modern C++ because it is safer and more predictable than using =.
                You can also write:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        int number = 5;
                        float pi = 3.14;
                    </code>
                </pre>
                but {} is recommended.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Printing Variables</h3>
        <p>
            You can print variables to the terminal like this:
        <pre>
                <code>
                #include &ltiostream&gt
                #include &ltstring&gt

                int main() {
                    int a {5};
                    // Prints 5 
                    std::cout &lt&lt a &lt&lt "\n";

                    a = 2;
                    // Prints 2
                    std::cout &lt&lt a &lt&lt "\n";

                    float b {3.15};
                    // Prints 3.15
                    std::cout &lt&lt b &lt&lt "\n";

                    std::string str {"This is a sentence"};
                    // Prints "This is a sentence"
                    std::cout &lt&lt str &lt&lt "\n";
                }
                </code>
            </pre>
        Key points:
        <ul>
            <li>
                // - Starts a comment. Comments are for programmers and are ignored by the compiler.
            </li>

            <li>
                std::cout &lt&lt a &lt&lt "\n"; - Prints the value of a and moves to the next line.
            </li>

            <li>
                a = 2; - Assigns a new value to a variable. You can do the same with float or std::string.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Arithmetic in C++</h3>
        <p>Now let's look at some basic arithmetic operations:</p>

        <pre>
            <code>
                #include &ltiostream&gt

                int main() {
                    int a {6};

                    // Addition
                    a = a + a; // 6 + 6 = 12
                    std::cout &lt&lt a &lt&lt "\n";

                    // Subtraction
                    a = a - a; // 6 - 6 = 0

                    // Multiplication
                    a = 6;
                    a = a * a; // 6 * 6 = 36

                    // Division (integer division)
                    a = 6;
                    a = a / 4; // Result: 1 (fraction is discarded)

                    // Modulo (remainder)
                    a = 6;
                    a = a % 4; // Result: 2
                }
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            These are the fundamental arithmetic operations in C++: <b>addition (+)</b>, <b>subtraction (-)</b>,
            <b>multiplication (*)</b>,
            <b>division</b> (/), and <b>modulo</b> (%).
            They will be essential for writing your first simple programs.

        <h2>How to Get Input from the User in C++</h2>
        <p>
            This is the last topic I'll cover in this article. Once you understand it, you'll be able to write simple
            programs — still without logic statements, but we'll explore those in the next article. So, let's get to the
            point.
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code>
                #include &ltiostream&gt

                int main() {
                    // Create a variable to store the user's input
                    int a {0};

                    // Get input from the user
                    std::cin &gt&gt a;

                    // Display the value entered by the user
                    std::cout &lt&lt a;
                }       
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>Explanation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In this example, we use two functions you already know or have seen before:

                <ul>
                    <li>std::cout - prints output to the terminal.</li>
                    <li>std::cin – gets input from the user via the terminal.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                The &gt&gt operator with std::cin stores the entered value into the variable on the right-hand side.
            </li>

            <li>
                In this example, we store the input in an int variable called a and then immediately print it back.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>You know now:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How to use basic input and output in C++.</li>
            <li>What variables are and how to declare them.</li>
            <li>How to perform basic arithmetic operations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With these fundamentals, you can already write small C++ programs.
            The next step is to learn logic statements like if/else and loops — the building blocks of more complex
            applications.
            See you in the next part!
